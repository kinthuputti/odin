    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom, and clove; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onions and sauté until translucent and beginning to turn golden, 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and sauté for 3 minutes. Stir in chili powder and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes; cook and stir until juices release, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, 3 tablespoons water, and lemon juice together in a bowl; stir into the chicken mixture until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven until sauce is somewhat thickened and concentrated, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring 2 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is about halfway cooked, about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken mixture from the oven. Stir in half-cooked rice, butter, and salt, then cover and bake for 1 hour. Stir in mint and cilantro before serving.</li>
    </ol>
